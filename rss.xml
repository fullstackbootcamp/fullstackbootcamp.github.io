Ruby is a beautiful programming language&quot;), mdx(&quot;p&quot;, null, &quot;Have you seen a code block of Ruby? It is very easy to read and understand among all programming languages. To illustrate, here are code examples from Ruby, C++, and PHP that all does the same thing.&quot;), mdx(&quot;h5&quot;, null, &quot;Ruby&quot;), mdx(&quot;pre&quot;, null, mdx(&quot;code&quot;, _extends({

  }, &quot;Thanks Richard Praxedes for these code examples!&quot;))), mdx(&quot;p&quot;, null, &quot;With these examples, we can see that you can do the same code from C++ and PHP in Ruy in a very short manner and very readable as well. And it saves a lot of time, having to code less.&quot;), mdx(&quot;h4&quot;, null, &quot;2. RoR is Stable and Mature&quot;), mdx(&quot;p&quot;, null, &quot;Ruby on Rails is old. It\u2019s about 14 years old. But, what that gives you is a very stable and mature platform that rarely breaks out of nowhere.&quot;), mdx(&quot;p&quot;, null, &quot;That age carries with it an excellent eco-system of well-maintained gems &quot;, mdx(&quot;em&quot;, {
    parentName: &quot;p&quot;
  }, &quot;(plugins)&quot;), &quot;. From authentication, blogging engines, to payment gateway integrations, there are no deficiencies of gems for Ruby.&quot;), mdx(&quot;h4&quot;, null, &quot;3. Strong focus on testing&quot;), mdx(&quot;p&quot;, null, &quot;Out of the box, Ruby on Rails has its own testing suite which you can use. The platform highly encourages you to do testing. But, the most popular testing framework for Ruby on Rails is RSpec which is very robust, self-documenting and really easy to read.&quot;), mdx(&quot;p&quot;, null, &quot;Here\u2019s an example of an RSpec test case.&quot;), mdx(&quot;pre&quot;, null, mdx(&quot;code&quot;, _extends({
    parentName: &quot;pre&quot;
  }, {
    &quot;className&quot;: &quot;language-ruby&quot;
  }), &quot;  describe &apos;#calc&apos; do\n    it &apos;returns a value&apos; do\n      result = subject.calc &apos;5 x 5&apos;\n\n      expect(result).to eq 25\n    end\n  end\n&quot;)), mdx(&quot;p&quot;, null, &quot;I think even non-coders would understand what this is testing out.&quot;), mdx(&quot;h4&quot;, null, &quot;4. Convention over configuration&quot;), mdx(&quot;p&quot;, null, &quot;Because the Ruby community values convention over configuration, moving from project to project is very easy because everyone follows the same guidelines and standards.&quot;), mdx(&quot;p&quot;, null, &quot;Also, taking over a Ruby on Rails project is easier for a RoR developer, given that the previous developer followed the community coding conventions.&quot;), mdx(&quot;h4&quot;, null, &quot;5. Community&quot;), mdx(&quot;p&quot;, null, &quot;Even though not as large as others, the Ruby community is one of the most active. There are also thousands of contributors maintaining the framework itself so it\u2019ll live longer than the others.&quot;), mdx(&quot;p&quot;, null, &quot;Also, if you\u2019re trying to look for answers, you will find the documentation of Ruby on Rails very detailed, and organized. Probably one of the better documentations for a platform that you will see.&quot;), mdx(&quot;hr&quot;, null), mdx(&quot;p&quot;, null, &quot;With that said, there are more reasons to love Ruby on Rails, and reasons to hate on it as well. I\u2019ll probably enumerate cons in another post.&quot;), mdx(&quot;h2&quot;, null, &quot;Hello from React!&quot;), mdx(&quot;p&quot;, null, &quot;Now that we\u2019ve discussed why Ruby on Rails, what is React JS anyway?&quot;), mdx(&quot;p&quot;, null, &quot;In a nutshell: React JS is a javascript library for creating interfaces.&quot;), mdx(&quot;p&quot;, null, &quot;Other javascript libraries similar to React are Angular, Vue, and Ember. Each of these libraries have their own advantages but I find React having the edge over the others.&quot;), mdx(&quot;h2&quot;, null, &quot;Why React JS?&quot;), mdx(&quot;p&quot;, null, &quot;This is pretty easy to figure out, other than it being the hottest thing right now for web. Again, I\u2019ll enumerate 5 reasons why I find React to be really useful.&quot;), mdx(&quot;h4&quot;, null, &quot;1. Low learning curve&quot;), mdx(&quot;p&quot;, null, &quot;Unlike Ruby on Rails, which people have said has a steep learning curve, React is very easy to learn and understand. It won\u2019t take you time to understand the different concepts about React since it is very light weight. I love their documentation and always find myslef referring back to it just to make sure what I\u2019m doing is right.&quot;), mdx(&quot;h4&quot;, null, &quot;2. Development Speed&quot;), mdx(&quot;p&quot;, null, &quot;Similar to Rails, React advocates for keeping everything DRY (Don\u2019t repeat Yourself), thus the strong focus on Components. React is all about reusability of code. Converting even the smallest reusable code to Components is what made me really push for React. Code once, use it all over the place, change it in one place.&quot;), mdx(&quot;h4&quot;, null, &quot;3. Components&quot;), mdx(&quot;p&quot;, null, &quot;React revolves around Components and it is a wonder. A Component may be a simple Function Component which you can pass props or attributes to, or it can be way more complex than that. A component can hold data in memory with the use of States, updates on the fly when actions are done, and has life cycle methods in it. These life cycle methods are basically instructions on what a component should do when it renders, or updates other than updating what it displays.&quot;), mdx(&quot;p&quot;, null, &quot;So, how does it look like?&quot;), mdx(&quot;p&quot;, null, &quot;Here\u2019s a simple Sidebar Drawer function component which toggles on click. (Yeah, we know how long this would take to do in other libraries.)&quot;), mdx(&quot;pre&quot;, null, mdx(&quot;code&quot;, _extends({
    parentName: &quot;pre&quot;
  }, {
    &quot;className&quot;: &quot;language-js&quot;
  }), &quot;import React, { useState } from &apos;react&apos;;\n\nconst links = [\n  { name: &apos;Home&apos;, url: &apos;/&apos; },\n  { name: &apos;Dashboard&apos;, url: &apos;/dashboard&apos; },\n  { name: &apos;My Profile&apos;, url: &apos;/dashboard/my-profile&apos; },\n  { name: &apos;Settings&apos;, url: &apos;/dashboard/settings&apos; },\n];\n\nconst Drawer = () =&gt; {\n  const [visible, setVisible] = useState(false);\n\n  return (\n    &lt;&gt;\n      &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; setVisible(!visible)}&gt;Toggle Drawer&lt;/button&gt;\n      &lt;div className={`drawer ${visible &amp;&amp; &apos;visible&apos;}`}&gt;\n        &lt;div className=\&quot;vertical-nav\&quot;&gt;\n          {links.map(link =&gt; (\n            &lt;a href={link.url}&gt;{link.name}&lt;/a&gt;\n          ))}\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n      &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/&gt;\n  );\n};\n\nexport default Drawer;\n&quot;)), mdx(&quot;p&quot;, null, &quot;That\u2019s how short the code is to make a Drawer. &quot;, mdx(&quot;em&quot;, {
    parentName: &quot;p&quot;
  }, &quot;(Of course this doesn\u2019t include the styling yet.)&quot;)), mdx(&quot;h4&quot;, null, &quot;4. Redux&quot;), mdx(&quot;p&quot;, null, &quot;Redux is one of the best state management packages out there. It integrates with all javascript libraries. Redux integrates seamlessly with React and is a breeze to use. Although, there is a high learning curve learning Redux, everyone learning React should atleast know the general concepts of Redux.&quot;), mdx(&quot;h4&quot;, null, &quot;5. React Native&quot;), mdx(&quot;p&quot;, null, &quot;The best part about React, React Native. It is a javascript framework for building cross-platform native apps using React JS. If you\u2019re a web developer who has a good foundation of Javascript and you want to do mobile apps, React Native is for you. Learning React JS first is a good foundation for React Native as it is absolutely the same thing. (Except that you can\u2019t use any HTML tags in React Native.)&quot;), mdx(&quot;hr&quot;, null), mdx(&quot;p&quot;, null, &quot;This is Facebook\u2019s brainchild, so there is no doubt about the support it gets. It is very well maintained, and there are just a flurry of updates to improve and make React even more better for everyone.&quot;), mdx(&quot;h2&quot;, null, &quot;Putting it all together&quot;), mdx(&quot;p&quot;, null, &quot;Ruby on Rails and React JS shares similar concepts in keeping everything DRY, and code reusability which makes using both together a no-brainer. Also, integrating React components with Rails is as easy as:&quot;), mdx(&quot;pre&quot;, null, mdx(&quot;code&quot;, _extends({
    parentName: &quot;pre&quot;
  }, {
    &quot;className&quot;: &quot;language-erb&quot;
  }), &quot;-- sample of an .html.erb layout\n\n-- other html tags\n&lt;body&gt;\n  &lt;header&gt;\n    &lt;%= react_component \&quot;Drawer\&quot;, prerender: true %&gt;\n  &lt;/header&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&quot;)), mdx(&quot;p&quot;, null, &quot;In my opinion, using two very efficient frameworks that lets you code less, and do more is absolutely the way to go.&quot;));
